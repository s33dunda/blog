# Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In

Four basic tenets:

1. separate the person — the emotion — from the problem;
2. don’t get wrapped up in the other side’s position (what they’re asking for),
   but instead focus on their interests (why they’re asking for it) so that you can find what they really want;
3. work cooperatively to generate win-win options; and,
4. establish mutually agreed-upon standards for evaluating those possible solutions.
