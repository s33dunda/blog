# Seeds & Services: A Plant-Based Glossary

Its difficult to explain technical concepts to non-technical people. It's especially difficult to explain Platform Engineering concepts to non-technical people let alone to other technical people. So I've thrown together a glossary of plant-based metaphors for technical concepts. Since people can relate to farming or gardening. Not to mention the robots will kick us off the ranch soon anyway.

!!! tip "Using This Glossary"

    This glossary works with tooltips throughout the site! When you see an italicized term in our documentation that's defined here, hovering over it will show its technical meaning. The glossary is case-insensitive, so terms will be recognized regardless of capitalization.

??? info "Setup Instructions"

    To enable the glossary functionality site-wide:

        1. Add these extensions to your `mkdocs.yml`:
           ```yaml
           markdown_extensions:
             - abbr
             - attr_list
             - pymdownx.snippets
           ```

        2. Create an `includes/case-insensitive-abbreviations.md` file with definitions based on this glossary (include variations for uppercase, lowercase, and mixed case for each term)

        3. Include the abbreviations file in your docs with:
           ```markdown
           --8<-- "includes/case-insensitive-abbreviations.md"
           ```

## The Garden Ecosystem (Platform)

!!! abstract "From Seeds to Plants"

    | Metaphor | Technical Meaning | Actual Biological Meaning | Abbreviation Format |
    |----------|-------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
    | **Seeds** | Containers/Images | Plant embryos encased in protective coverings that contain all genetic instructions and initial resources needed to grow into a complete plant | \*[Seeds]: Container images waiting to grow into running plants |
    | **Plants** | Applications | Autonomous living organisms that process resources, respond to stimuli, and fulfill specific functions within an ecosystem | \*[Plants]: Applications running in your infrastructure |
    | **Garden/Farm** | Entire infrastructure landscape | A managed ecosystem with intentionally selected and arranged plant species to optimize for desired outputs | \*[Garden]: The complete infrastructure landscape |
    | **Plots** | VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds) | Distinct growing areas separated by physical boundaries that prevent cross-contamination and allow different growing conditions | \*[Plots]: Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) that isolate resources |
    | **Sub-plots** | Subnets within VPCs | Further subdivisions within growing areas for specialized plant groupings with similar requirements | \*[Sub-plots]: Subnets within VPCs providing further network segmentation |
    | **Soil/Nutrients** | Memory resources | The structural medium containing minerals and compounds that determine what the plant can do and sustain | Soil quality/composition limits what can grow; enriching soil is a more intensive process than adding water (like memory upgrades vs CPU scaling); running out of key nutrients creates hard constraints regardless of other resources |
    | **Water** | CPU resources | The fluid resource that enables metabolic processes and active functions; plants can quickly adjust water usage based on conditions | Water powers immediate processes like photosynthesis (similar to CPU executing tasks); it's consumed during activity and must be constantly replenished; plants can temporarily reduce water usage when needed (like CPU throttling) |
    | **Sunlight** | Energy/Electricity | The fundamental energy input that drives all plant processes | Powers the entire system; without it, nothing else matters; varies naturally but generally isn't directly controlled by the gardener. A steady resource when running in the clouds |
    | **Environmental Stressors** | Traffic/User load | External demands that trigger plant responses and resource consumption | Causes plants to allocate resources differently; creates pressure on systems; varies seasonally and sometimes unpredictably |

    ## Advanced Concepts: Plant Communication & Connectivity

    TBD

    ### Chemical Signaling (VOCs)

    Plants communicate through volatile organic compounds (VOCs) - chemicals released into the air that other plants can detect and respond to.
    TBD

    ### Mycorrhizal Networks

    Underground fungal networks that connect plant roots and facilitate resource sharing - nature's original internet.

    TBD

    ### Electrical/Calcium Wave Signaling

    Plants use electrical signals and calcium waves to communicate across their structures.

    TBD

    ### Sound/Vibration Communication

    Plants can produce and respond to sounds and vibrations in their environment.

    TBD

    ### Root Networks

    The underground infrastructure that supports and connects plants.

    TBD

    ## Plant Lifecycle & Growth

    TBD

    ## Monitoring & Maintenance

    TBD

    ## Platform Engineering Elements

    TBD

    ## Human Elements

    TBD

!!! tip "Using This Glossary"

    This glossary is designed to help you think about technical systems in a more intuitive, organic way. Feel free to use these metaphors in your own discussions and documentation to make complex concepts more approachable. The glossary recognizes terms regardless of capitalization, so you can write "seeds", "Seeds", or "SEEDS" and the tooltip will still appear.

!!! info "The Science Behind the Metaphors"

    These metaphors aren't just poetic - they're based on real plant biology. Plants communicate through chemical signals, fungal networks, electrical impulses, and even sound waves, creating complex adaptive systems similar to our technical infrastructures.
