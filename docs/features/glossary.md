# Seeds & Services: A Plant-Based Glossary

It's difficult to explain technical concepts to non-technical people. And especially difficult to explain Platform Engineering concepts to non-technical people let alone to other technical people. So I've been using garden-based metaphors to help explain things. People can relate to farming/gardening and, just like before, the machines will soon kick many of us off the ranch.

!!! abstract "From Seeds to Services"

## The Garden Foundation (Infrastructure)

| Metaphor | Technical Meaning | Plant Meaning | Abbreviation Format |
|----------|------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Soil** | Platform/runtime environment | Growing medium that provides physical support and nutrients | *[Soil]: Platform and runtime environment where applications grow* |
| **Garden/Farm** | Organization/business | Cultivated ecosystem with multiple plant species working together | *[Garden]: The complete organization or business ecosystem* |
| **Sunlight** | Electricity/power | Primary energy source that powers photosynthesis and growth | *[Sunlight]: Electricity and power supporting the infrastructure* |

## Plant Life (Applications)

| Metaphor | Technical Meaning | Plant Meaning | Abbreviation Format |
|----------|------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Seeds** | Container images | Embryonic plant structures containing genetic instructions | *[Seeds]: Container images waiting to grow into running services* |
| **Plants** | Running containers/applications | Living organisms that grow, process resources, and respond to their environment | *[Plants]: Running containers and applications in your infrastructure* |
| **Fruits** | Tangible outputs/assets | Developed structures containing seeds and resources for reproduction and dispersal | *[Fruits]: Tangible outputs and assets produced by applications* |

## Resources (Compute)

| Metaphor | Technical Meaning | Plant Meaning | Abbreviation Format |
|----------|------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Sap** | Memory (internal resource management) | Fluid carrying nutrients, sugars, and signals throughout the plant | *[Sap]: Memory and internal resource management* |
| **Enzymes** | CPU/Processing power | Biological catalysts that enable metabolic reactions and energy conversion | *[Enzymes]: CPU and processing power that drive applications* |

## Flow Systems (Data & Communication)

| Metaphor | Technical Meaning | Plant Meaning | Abbreviation Format |
|----------|------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Water** | Data flow | Essential transport medium that moves nutrients and enables biological processes | *[Water]: Data flow throughout your system* |
| **Carbon Dioxide** | Input data | Raw material absorbed from the environment for processing | *[Carbon Dioxide]: Input data that applications process* |
| **Oxygen** | Data outputs/responses | Processed output released back into the environment | *[Oxygen]: Data outputs and responses produced by applications* |

## Plant Communication & Connectivity

### Chemical Signaling (VOCs)

Plants communicate through volatile organic compounds (VOCs) - chemicals released into the air that other plants can detect and respond to.
TBD

### Mycorrhizal Networks

Underground fungal networks that connect plant roots and facilitate resource sharing - nature's original internet.

TBD

### Electrical/Calcium Wave Signaling

Plants use electrical signals and calcium waves to communicate across their structures.

TBD

### Sound/Vibration Communication

Plants can produce and respond to sounds and vibrations in their environment.

TBD

### Root Networks

The underground infrastructure that supports and connects plants.

TBD

## Plant Lifecycle & Growth

TBD

## Monitoring & Maintenance

TBD

## Platform Engineering Elements

TBD

## Human Elements

TBD

!!! tip "Using This Glossary"

    This glossary is designed to help you think about technical systems in a more intuitive, organic way. Feel free to use these metaphors in your own discussions and documentation to make complex concepts more approachable.

!!! info "The Science Behind the Metaphors"

    These metaphors aren't just poetic - they're based on real plant biology. Plants communicate through chemical signals, fungal networks, electrical impulses, and even sound waves, creating complex adaptive systems similar to our technical infrastructures.
