# Seeds & Services: A Plant-Based Glossary

I see the natural parallels between plants and technology. This glossary maps the journey from seed to thriving ecosystem, helping you understand modern DevOps, SRE, and Platform Engineering concepts through the familiar lens of plant life. As Platform Engineers, the goal is to create a platform where apps can thrive like seeds in the fertile crescent. And like the industrial revolution, we'll 90% of us 

!!! tip "Using This Glossary"

    This glossary works with tooltips throughout the site! When you see an italicized term in our documentation that's defined here, hovering over it will show its technical meaning. The glossary is case-insensitive, so terms will be recognized regardless of capitalization.

!!! tip "Using This Glossary"

    This glossary is designed to help you think about technical systems in a more intuitive, organic way. Feel free to use these metaphors in your own discussions and documentation to make complex concepts more approachable. The glossary recognizes terms regardless of capitalization, so you can write "seeds", "Seeds", or "SEEDS" and the tooltip will still appear.

!!! info "The Science Behind the Metaphors"

    These metaphors aren't just poetic - they're based on real plant biology. Plants communicate through chemical signals, fungal networks, electrical impulses, and even sound waves, creating complex adaptive systems similar to our technical infrastructures.
