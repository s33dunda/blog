# Seeds & Services: A Plant-Based Glossary

It's difficult to explain technical concepts to non-technical people. And especially difficult to explain Platform Engineering concepts to non-technical people let alone to other technical people. So I've been using garden-based metaphors to help explain things. People can relate to farming/gardening and, just like before, the machines will soon kick many of us off the ranch.

## The Garden Ecosystem (Platform)

!!! tip "Using This Glossary"
    This glossary is designed to help you think about technical systems in a more intuitive, organic way. Feel free to use these metaphors in your own discussions and documentation to make complex concepts more approachable.

!!! info "The Science Behind the Metaphors" 
    These metaphors aren't just poetic - they're based on real plant biology. Plants communicate through chemical signals, fungal networks, electrical impulses, and even sound waves, creating complex adaptive systems similar to our technical infrastructures.
