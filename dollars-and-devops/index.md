Airbus A380
Biggest mistake
built to compete with Boeing 747
They built it too big and no one wanted it
why? No flexibility
(this is why we move in with the code and use charts as dependencies)
Ask what will move KPI by 25-50%
define KPI MVPlatforms
build that
verify improvement
go back to step 1
what is the KPI??????

`Benefit = # of support tickets * hours/ticket * hourly rate`

Week 1 10 tickets a week
Week 2 9 tickets a week (cause self service)
2 hours per ticket == concrete savings

Assumptions and Objections

1. you devops team can utilize the extra time to accelerate roadmap OR you wont need to hire extra people

common objections

1. devs don't open tickets, they message us on slack
2. no visibility into questions (DMs)
3. Metrics are not accurate
4. Quality of answer is different

To plan work for the next sprint:

1. where do we have the most support tickets?
2. why?
3. How can we replace those tickets with self-service?
4. What is the fastest and simplest way to do so?
5. ... do it
6. Did it work?

Dev side:
`Benefit = support ticket * hours block per ticket * devs blocked * hourly rate`
